Meddle is the dating app that lets your friends swipe for you.

## Single View Applications

As a mobile engineer at Meddle, Inc I designed and developed single view applications for animations to detect touch gestures using UIKit dynamic methods. I also refined boilerplate code using protocol extensions to reduce complexity.

An example of the types of single view applications I built is a view of the application that users would see when they are swiping left or right for a friend in order to find the right match.
